                <h2>Polina Petrova</h2>
                 </div>
                <p> Born and raised in Stalingrad, Polina Petrova is a soldier not by choice, but by a need to defend her country. Stalingrad was her childhood home, one where she lived many happy memories, including hunting with her father and brother. Although she lost her mother a decade prior to the war, her reality was even more impacted by the brutal Axis invasion of Operation Barbarossa. Using the sharpshooting skills, she learned from her family, Petrova’s story is one of vengeance and retribution for all that she and her community lost.
<br>
<br>
Polina is a woman of few words, but when she speaks, it is with purpose and often leaves a powerful impact. She’s content in her own company, only opening up to those she trusts and respects deeply with sharp and educated wit. Although she barely shares what is on her mind, her actions speak for her opinions. 
<br>
<br>
Often, she takes matters into her own hands and never waits for anyone else, especially when her thirst for vengeance takes over and puts her in a blind rage.Whether by words or action, Polina is driven by a desire to see her home free from Nazi invaders, and she is not afraid to put this personal pursuit above her duties.
She was initially put into a medical unit, instead of being a sniper. Boris told her and her brother Misha to have breakfast with him. Afterwards, she carried molotovs to where Misha is, and afterwards, she goes to the rooftop to report on her duty. She arrived to where her station when the Nazis air raided their camp, prompting her to return to their home.
<br>
<br>
She returned to the house after encountering Germans, taking her dad's rifle. She saw her dad executed by the Germans and fought her way to the site. She then tried to find Misha, rescuing him and a handful of new recruits about to be executed by the Germans. She provided a distraction, allowing Misha and the others to secure the tunnels.
